<!-- 

	You are given 3 main variables (no need to define them, they are already created for you):

		- $project, which contains all the info about the project you may need. It is an object
		with the form project(title, description, priority, manager, location, budget, start_date, end_date)
		To get any property of this object, call $project->property (e.g. $project->title)

		- $staff is an array of objects. Similar to before, but this time you don't know how long the array is.
		The objects are staff(id, name, role, assigned_at, pay_rate). Same as before, you can access any 
		property calling: $staff->name etc. However, this time, it is an array. thus to access the name
		of the first employee, you would do $staff[0]->name, etc. It is more efficient doing it with a loop
		See the one I wrote for you. Use that to iterate through the unknown size array.

		- $dashboard is an array of dashboard entries(description, date). Same as staff, access it as an 
		array, and use a loop to show all entries.
