# PurpleSky

We are a group of students from Heriot-Watt University and this is our 3rd Year Project. 
It involves designing, coding, deploying and managing a website for an example customer customer, Leidos.
It is also formed by people from different courses: Computer Science, Computer Systems, Information Systems and Electrical Engineering.

A live version of this project can be found [here](http://www2.macs.hw.ac.uk/~fjc3/ "People+").

We call this product People+. You can find more marketing information at our [group website](http://davidbrisbane96.wixsite.com/purplesky "PurpleSky").
